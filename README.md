# CS360-Mod7Project
Module 7 Project - Weight tracking application, with SQLite database.

### Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

For the design and development of this application, I began the process of creating a weight management and tracking application.  Using Android Studio and SQLite database, I was able to address the beginning development and design processes of a mobile application.  I thoroughly enjoyed utilizing SQLite and thinking of the multitude of ways it could be used in new application, or one needing a handy serverless database solution.  Implementing many of the app requirements was difficult, but turned out to be a great learning experience.  I was surpirsed how easily Android Studio can request permissions from users, and the the speed at which new applications can be rapdily prototyped using the built in design editor.

### What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

For this project three screens were necessary, these screens were; login, dashboard, and permissions/settings.  In my attempt to keep the users in mind during the UI design process, I tried to create a very simple to digest layout on my dashboard page, where users can navigate to and from the page as well as logout.  If I was to recreate the application and change the design and UI layout, I would choose to include a calendar on the dashboard so users can see how their weight has fluctuated over time or over the course of a few weeks.

### How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

For the process of coding my application, I began by creating a very primitive diagram so that I could visualize the processes that needed to take place to create a new user and populate their dashboard with their unique user data.  In addition to this, the creation of the UI design itself helped me to visualize the flow of the application and how I would need to link my code with the user's interaction of the GUI.

### How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

To ensure my code was functional I ran the application during its development, and also made changes live while debugging to test different inputs and unique user interactions.  Looking back at these processes, this would be a great example of where writing unit tests could be a fast and efficient way of testing database functionality without having to create complex UI components to simulate interactions with the application running.  I found this reflection process beneficial, an application any larger than this one would need to have some testing functionality built in to ensure it was working properly and to test the database against different attacks or incorrect usages.  One example of this would be safeguarding against the injection of SQL queries into forms and input fields.

### Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

Considering the full app design and development process, I found I needed to innovate and overcome most when working with SQLite.  Because working with databases is still such a foreign experience for me I found it difficult to properly structure the application in a way that was able reusable and performative.  I also found this to be the must fulfilling and fun part of the development process as I gained some valuable experience working the SQL as well as structuring an application that needs database functionality.  Though creating the userinterface was a challenge, I found that it abstracted much of the development away from the design process, making it easier for an inexperienced mobile app developer like myself to jump in and experiment.

### In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

Creating the application UI and designing the seperate pages was by far my most successful demonstration during the entire development process.  I can't always put words on what I like or enjoy in an application, but found myself tinkering with all the different components and settings in order to get something that was both visually appealing and easy to digest for an application of this size.  I am happy to say I learned a substantial amount in this class and am exited to work with Android Studio in the future to create hobby projects.  In addition to this I was fascinated with SQLite and will continue to learn more about database design and implementation in mobile environments.
